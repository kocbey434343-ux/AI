- Production environment stress testing
- API connectivity verification

IMMEDIATE TESTING TASKS
=======================

**1. API Connectivity Test (5 minutes):**
```bash
python src/api/binance_api.py  # Test production API connection
```

**2. Core System Integration Test (15 minutes):**
```bash
python src/main.py  # Full system initialization test
```

**3. Performance Monitoring (Continuous):**
```bash
# Monitor metrics endpoint
curl http://localhost:8090/metrics
```

**4. Database Health Check (5 minutes):**
```bash
python check_database_health.py  # Verify DB operations
```
