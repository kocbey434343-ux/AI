## üé® Technical Implementation

### TWAP Algorithm Features
```python
# Optimal slice calculation
def _calculate_optimal_slices(self, quantity: float, duration_minutes: int) -> int:
    base_slices = max(2, min(20, duration_minutes // 5))
    quantity_factor = min(2.0, quantity / 10000)
    return int(base_slices * quantity_factor)

# Equal time distribution with conservative participation
slice_interval = duration_minutes / num_slices
max_participation_rate = 0.15  # Conservative for TWAP
```

### VWAP Algorithm Features  
```python
# Volume profile analysis
def _get_volume_profile(self, symbol: str, duration_minutes: int) -> List[float]:
    # Simulated volume profile based on typical market patterns
    # Higher volume during market open/close hours
    
# Volume-weighted slice creation
def _create_volume_weighted_slices(self, total_quantity: float, 
                                 volume_profile: List[float],
                                 target_participation: float) -> List[ExecutionSlice]:
    # Distribute quantity according to volume profile
    # Adjust participation rates based on expected volume
```

### Smart Router Logic
```python
# Market condition analysis
def _analyze_market_conditions(self, symbol: str, quantity: float) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        "liquidity_score": 0.7,      # Order book depth analysis
        "volatility_score": 0.4,     # Price volatility assessment  
        "spread_score": 0.8,         # Bid-ask spread evaluation
        "volume_score": 0.6,         # Volume analysis
        "size_impact": "medium"      # Order size impact classification
    }

# Strategy selection optimization
def _select_optimal_strategy(self, candidates: List[ExecutionPlan]) -> ExecutionPlan:
    # Select strategy with lowest estimated cost
    return min(candidates, key=lambda plan: plan.estimated_cost_bps)
```
