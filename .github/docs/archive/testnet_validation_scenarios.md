## 📊 Test Data Requirements

### Testnet Account Setup
- Minimum 1000 USDT testnet balance
- Access to major trading pairs (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, etc.)
- Both spot and futures trading enabled
- API keys with all required permissions

### Test Duration
- **Phase 1**: Quick validation (30 minutes) - Basic functionality
- **Phase 2**: Extended testing (4 hours) - Stability and performance
- **Phase 3**: Stress testing (24 hours) - Production simulation

## 🚀 Execution Plan

1. **Pre-test Setup**: Configure testnet API keys and environment
2. **Smoke Tests**: Run basic functionality validation (T1-T3)
3. **Integration Tests**: Execute full trading scenarios (T4-T6)
4. **Advanced Features**: Test ML pipeline and complex systems (T7)
5. **Stress Testing**: Extended runtime and error scenarios (T8-T9)
