Complete Inventory Summary (Generated 2025-08-24)
===============================================
Master index of all inventory files created for trade_bot project.

Inventory Files Created:
1. inventorys/api_inventory.txt - API modules (binance_api, health_check, price_stream)
2. inventorys/backtest_inventory.txt - Backtest modules (orchestrator, calibrate)
3. inventorys/core_inventory.txt - Core modules (data_fetcher, indicators, risk_manager, signal_generator, UI)
4. inventorys/trader_inventory.txt - Trader modules (core, execution, guards, metrics, trailing)
5. inventorys/utils_inventory.txt - Utility modules (correlation_cache, feature_flags, helpers, logger, order_state, structured_log, trade_store, ws_utils)
6. inventorys/config_inventory.txt - Configuration modules (settings, runtime_thresholds, runtime_costs, indicators.json)
7. inventorys/scripts_inventory.txt - Script utilities (apply_migrations, backup_snapshot, create_tag, secret_scan, smoke_tests)
8. inventorys/tests_inventory_part1.txt - Test suite (trader flow, reconciliation, position sizing)
9. inventorys/tests_inventory_part2.txt - Test suite (metrics, anomaly, trailing persistence)
10. inventorys/tests_inventory_part3.txt - Test suite (remaining tests, UI, websocket, utilities)
11. inventorys/docs_inventory.txt - Documentation files (architecture, improvement plan, workflow, extensions, dependencies)
12. inventorys/root_main_inventory.txt - Root files (main.py, requirements.txt, configuration files, launcher scripts)
13. inventorys/github_data_inventory.txt - GitHub config and data directory (SSoT, prompts, data files, logs)
14. inventorys/complete_inventory_summary.txt - This summary file

Total Coverage:
- Source code modules: ~30 Python files across src/ hierarchy
- Configuration files: Settings, runtime configs, indicators JSON
- Test files: ~35 test modules with comprehensive coverage
- Documentation: Architecture docs, improvement plans, workflow guides
- Scripts & utilities: Migration, backup, tagging, security scanning tools
- Data & infrastructure: GitHub config, data directories, log management
- Root project files: Entry points, dependencies, launchers, discipline docs

Key Insights from Inventory Process:
1. Modular Architecture: Clear separation of concerns across trader/, api/, utils/ packages
2. Comprehensive Testing: Multi-layer test strategy (unit, integration, UI smoke)
3. Strong Governance: SSoT-driven development with CR/ADR tracking
4. Operational Tools: Complete toolkit for deployment, backup, migration, security
5. Data Pipeline: Well-structured flow from raw data → processing → analytics → optimization

Major Gaps Identified:
1. Some empty test files (test_quantize_and_partial.py) need implementation or removal
2. Scaled_out persistence not fully implemented (documented gap)
3. ATR trailing block potentially dead code (needs decision)
4. ASCII policy enforcement could be automated via pre-commit
5. Cross-platform launcher scripts missing (only Windows .bat files)

Recommended Next Actions:
1. Address empty/placeholder test files
2. Implement missing persistence features (scaled_out state)
3. Decide on ATR trailing feature activation
4. Add cross-platform support (Unix shell scripts)
5. Create automated ASCII compliance checking
6. Add data retention/cleanup policies
7. Implement backup/restore procedures for critical data

Project Maturity Assessment:
- Architecture: Mature (modular, well-documented)
- Testing: Good (comprehensive coverage with identified gaps)
- Documentation: Excellent (SSoT-driven with inventories)
- Operations: Good (scripts present, some gaps in automation)
- Governance: Excellent (CR/ADR process, change tracking)
- Security: Good (secret scanning, environment isolation)

Total Files Inventoried: ~100+ files across all categories
