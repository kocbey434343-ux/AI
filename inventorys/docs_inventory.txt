Documentation Inventory (Generated 2025-08-24)
===========================================
Scope: docs/*.md, root README, migrations README.

1. ARCHITECTURE_TRADER.md
-------------------------
Purpose: High-level architecture overview of modular Trader system (core, guards, execution, trailing, metrics).
Key Sections: Module table, signal->position flow, price update flow, DB schema summary, guard chain, partial & trailing logic, metrics, dev notes, test strategy.
Inputs Referenced: Settings (risk/trailing), TradeStore schema, Runtime thresholds.
Outputs: Conceptual guidance; no code execution.
Gaps / Improvements:
 - Add diagram (Mermaid) for R-multiple based trailing steps.
 - Explicit state diagram for position life-cycle (OPENING->OPEN->SCALING->CLOSING->CLOSED) referencing order_state FSM.
 - Link CR IDs where features implemented (e.g., CR-0016 for trailing persistence).

2. IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md
----------------------
Purpose: Strategic improvement roadmap with prioritized tasks (P0..P3) across reliability, risk, reconciliation, tests, performance, architecture, observability, analytics, security, DX.
Highlights: Top 7 sprint tasks; targeted exception refactor; partial fill RR recalculation; structured logging; order state machine.
Gaps:
 - Some items now accomplished (e.g., structured logging partial adoption) should sync status.
 - Add mapping to CR IDs for traceability.

3. DEV_WORKFLOW_WITH_EXTENSIONS.md
----------------------------------
Purpose: Developer workflow leveraging VS Code extensions (Black, Ruff, SonarLint, Data Wrangler, etc.).
Content: Quality tools, test loop, data analysis, DB inspection, logging, GUI tools, security, recommended settings JSON, TODO for extension-focused tasks.
Gaps:
 - Could integrate pre-commit hook examples referencing create_tag & secret_scan.
 - Add section on ASCII policy enforcement script.

4. EXTENSIONS_TODO.md
---------------------
Purpose: Auto-generated list of installed / failed extensions with usage notes and TODOs.
Gaps:
 - Mark duplicates vs other docs; unify with DEV_WORKFLOW file to prevent drift.
 - Add column for criticality (Must/Optional).

5. module_dependency_diagram.md
-------------------------------
Purpose: Mermaid diagram of module dependencies + state fields & core flows.
Includes: Position state field list; development suggestions; version revision.
Gaps:
 - Rev version (v1.11) should sync with SSoT overall revision (currently 1.35) or clarify independent numbering.
 - Add structured_log module (utils.structured_log) to Infra cluster.
 - Include Backtest modules (backtest/calibrate, orchestrator) for completeness.

6. SESSION_SUMMARY.md
---------------------
Purpose: Rolling session change summaries (recent enhancements: hysteresis, calibration, dynamic sizing, UI auto calibration).
Gaps:
 - Convert ad-hoc notes into CR entries where missing.
 - Add timestamp headers standardization (ISO format).

7. migrations/README.md
-----------------------
Purpose: Light migration system rules (NNN_description.sql naming, applied tracking file).
Gaps:
 - Missing example migration file and rollback note template.
 - Add checksum or hash recommendation.

8. README.md (root)
-------------------
Purpose: Public project overview (features, risk mgmt, cost model, metrics, runtime cost persistence, logging, roadmap, disclaimer).
Gaps:
 - Some features now implemented (websocket, trailing, partial exits) should mark status or moved from roadmap.
 - Add quick start including .env example; mention OFFLINE_MODE auto behaviour.
 - Security note could reference secret_scan script & pre-commit.

Cross-Document Observations
---------------------------
 - Overlap between IMPROVEMENT_PLAN and README roadmap; consider single source & link.
 - Ensure ASCII-only policy reflected (some Turkish diacritics presentâ€”policy allows in docs but clarify).
 - Add index in docs/README linking to each document for navigation.

Recommended Actions
-------------------
 - Sync diagram rev & SSoT rev; add structured_log & backtest to dependency graph.
 - Create docs/INDEX.md auto-generated linking inventory.
 - Add CR references inline (e.g., (CR-0016) near trailing persistence doc sections).
 - Provide migration template file (sample NNN_description.sql) and hash verification guidance.
